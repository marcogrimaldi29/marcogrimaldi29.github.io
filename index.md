## 🌍 About This Site

I built this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme to keep things simple and focused.
It’s meant to be both a **personal hub** and a **learning log** — a place where I collect useful resources and share what I’ve been working on.

For more information, check the [About section](/about/) of this site.
