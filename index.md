## 👋 Welcome

I’m **Marco Grimaldi** — IT Consultant, Cloud Enthusiast, and Language Trainer.  

Sparked by curiosity, fueled by challenges, and adaptable enough to keep trying to debug life, even if the patch notes never end.

This site is my digital space to share professional resources, certification reviews, and personal passions like hiking trails.

## 🌍 About This Site

I built this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme to keep things simple and focused.
It’s meant to be both a **personal hub** and a **learning log** — a place where I collect useful resources and share what I’ve been working on.

For more information, check the [About section](/about/) of this site.
