## üéØ Beyond the Tech: Why I Took the Google Project Management Certificate 

**‚ùó Just a heads-up:** This review reflects my personal experience only.
{: .notice--info}

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Intro 

Hello everyone! Following up on my previous post about the Google IT Support Certificate, I would like to talk about the next step in my IT professional development: the **Google Project Management Professional Certificate**. This was my second Google certification, and it gave me a great understanding of everything about project management types, procedures, and the entire project lifecycle.

For me, this certificate wasn‚Äôt about pivoting directly into a management role. I was more interested in understanding how management and leadership work in order to see the bigger picture. In any IT role ‚Äî whether support, development, or system administration ‚Äî you‚Äôre part of a larger project. Knowing the principles that drive those projects ‚Äî planning, communication, risk management ‚Äî is invaluable, and not only in IT but across many professions.

This certificate offers a clear and practical guide to what it takes to be a successful project manager. More importantly, it provides crucial context for anyone working within a team. That‚Äôs why I considered it an excellent complement to the IT Support certificate.

### üìö The Syllabus: A Deep Dive into Project Management

The program is structured into six courses, each building on the last to provide a complete understanding of the field and the entire project lifecycle. From the fundamentals to advanced methodologies, this curriculum prepares you for a real-world project environment.

The six courses are:

* **Foundations of Project Management**: This course introduces you to the **core concepts and roles within project management**. You'll learn about the project lifecycle, from initiation to closure, and the key responsibilities of a project manager.

* **Project Initiation: Starting a Successful Project**: Here, you'll learn **how to define project goals, deliverables, and scope**. This course focuses on creating project charters, managing stakeholders, and setting up a project for success from the very beginning.

* **Project Planning: Putting It All Together**: This course is all about **creating a detailed plan**. You'll cover essential topics like building work breakdown structures, estimating timelines, managing budgets, and identifying potential risks.

* **Project Execution: Running the Show**: This is where you learn to manage the **day-to-day operations of a project**. You'll focus on effective communication, resolving conflicts, and using tools to monitor progress.

* **Agile Project Management**: The course delves into Agile, a popular and flexible project management methodology. You'll learn the principles behind **Scrum** and **Kanban** and how to apply them to manage projects more effectively in fast-paced environments.

* **Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World**: This is the culmination of everything you've learned. The capstone project requires you to **apply all the concepts and skills to a real-world scenario**. You'll go through the entire project lifecycle, from defining the project to creating a detailed plan and a final report.

### üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Peer-Reviewed Assignments and the Capstone Project

One of the most valuable parts of this certificate, and what sets it apart, is the emphasis on **peer-reviewed assignments** and the **Capstone project**. Unlike other exam modalities, such as multiple-choice exams, these tasks require you to apply what you've learned practically.

* **Peer-Reviewed Assignments**: Throughout the courses, you'll submit projects and plans that are reviewed by your fellow learners. This process not only provides valuable feedback but also allows you to see different approaches and learn from your peers. This **enhanced the learning and practical experience** by giving me a sense of what collaboration and feedback look like in a professional setting, where achieving a common goal is a team effort.

* **The Capstone Project**: This is the final and most significant part of the certificate. You take on a comprehensive project from start to finish. For me, this experience was instrumental. It wasn't just about passing a test; it was about demonstrating my ability to **manage a project in its entirety**. It truly validated my skills and gave me the confidence to step into a project management role.

### üì¶ Final Remarks and Key Takeaways

The course is accessible on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management) and for learners based in Spain, scholarship opportunities are available through [Experiencia Fundae](https://experienciafundae.es/) by [clicking here](https://experienciafundae.es/beca-google).

#### üó™ Beyond the Course: Extra Perks

One thing I didn't mention in [üöÄ My Journey into IT: How the Google IT Support Professional Certificate Paved the Way](/google-it-support/) is that platforms like Coursera and Udemy often provide extensive caption and subtitle options. This means you can absorb subject-related content while simultaneously boosting your reading comprehension in other languages. It can be a little bit of cognitive extra stress, but it's a great way to build matter-related vocabulary.

Also, project management requires an essential skill for professionals: using spreadsheets. Since the amount of resources and readings can be overwhelming, I recommend creating a spreadsheet to track what you've learned. A great, free option is [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), which keeps you in the same "environment". These are just suggestions, though; what works best for you should always be your first choice.

#### üìä The Overall Impact

All in all, the project lifecycle and Agile methodologies covered in this certificate imply crucial skills and knowledge that can benefit anyone, including non-IT professionals. The course helped me challenge my usual methods and *modus operandi* for tackling tasks. It prompted me to rethink and try out new approaches, which have expanded my personal skill set. If you've never attended related classes, I'm confident this collection of courses will give a significant boost to your *repertoire* as well.

**üö® Disclaimer:** This article is solely based on my personal account. I have not received any endorsement from Google or any related party. I aim to share insights that may help others assess whether the Google Project Management Professional Certificate aligns with their own objectives and needs. Whenever possible, I also encourage you to look into available scholarships or community resources that may foster lifelong learning for a more accessible educational experience.
