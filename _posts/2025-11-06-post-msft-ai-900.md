## 🔐 AI-900 Overview: Azure AI Fundamentals

**❗ Just a heads-up:** This review reflects my personal experience only. It is not sponsored or endorsed in any way.
{: .notice--info}

### ℹ️ Introduction

It was December 2022 when I obtained my **AI-900** certification which marked the fourth milestone in my Microsoft certification path — and what a transformative one it was. Attending a free Microsoft Virtual Event offered invaluable insights into AI use cases and industry perspectives, making it an excellent complement to formal study. **Achieving AI-900 didn’t just enhance my proficiency with Microsoft’s AI offerings — it also sharpened my grasp of AI theory, its ethical considerations, and real-world applications** across sectors. Additionally, it complements my prior certifications, such as the [SC-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-sc-900/), the [PL-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-pl-900/), and [AZ-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-az-900/), by deepening my understanding of AI within the broader context of cloud computing and security fundamentals.

### 🧠 Why AI-900 Matters

* **Accessible and beginner-friendly**: Designed for both technical and non-technical professionals, the Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) exam introduces essential AI and machine learning concepts without requiring any prior experience in data science.
* **Builds Microsoft AI fluency**: You’ll explore key Azure AI workloads including computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), generative AI, conversational bots, and no-code AI tools.
* **Promotes responsible AI awareness**: Learn about vital AI theory topics such as regression, classification, and ethical principles like fairness, transparency, reliability, and responsible AI.
* **A stepping stone toward advanced certifications**: AI-900 provides a solid foundation for deeper paths such as the AI-102: Azure AI Engineer Associate certification — perfect for anyone aiming to specialize further in AI development on Azure. (I earned this certification in mid-2024 and will cover it in a future article.)

**🔜 Coming soon:** I earned the AI-102 certification in mid-2024 and will cover it in a dedicated review article soon.

### 💡 Practical Tips for Passing SC-900

* **Leverage official Microsoft Learn paths**: Use Microsoft’s [free learning modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-900t00), which directly follow the exam outline and are updated regularly.
* **Use practice exams strategically**: Microsoft’s [practice assessments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/practice-assessments-for-microsoft-certifications) are closely aligned with the test and highlight areas needing improvement.
* **Track weak areas**: Practice assessments provide a breakdown of your performance, making it easier to focus revision where it’s most needed.
* **Know the exam mechanics**:  
  - Expect ~40–60 questions in multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, or true/false formats. 
  - You’ll have [~45 minutes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/exam-duration-exam-experience#exam-duration) to complete the test, need a score of [700/1000](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exam-scoring-reports#scores-needed-to-pass-exams) to pass, and can choose between online proctoring or an in-person Pearson VUE center.

### 🗂️ Study Strategy

When preparing for this certification — and later Fundamentals exams — I followed a simple but effective strategy:

* **Organize your study materials**: Gather and structure all relevant resources early on so they’re easy to revisit when reviewing key topics.
* **Watch [John Savill's Study Cram video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTkUTkXrqOQ)**: Whether before, during, or after completing the learning paths, Savill’s videos are incredibly helpful. He has a knack for simplifying complex Azure concepts and explaining them with clarity and enthusiasm.
* **Complete Microsoft’s official [AI-900 course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-900t00)**: This free Microsoft course is comprehensive, regularly updated, and fully aligned with the current exam objectives.
* **Stay confident on exam day**: By the time you take the test, you’ll have built a solid foundation through structured preparation. Focus on what you know, manage your time effectively, and keep a calm, clear mindset.

### 🎟️ Exam Vouchers and Discounts

When I took the AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals exam in late 2022, I was fortunate to receive a **free exam voucher** through a **Microsoft Virtual Training Day**. The experience turned out to be incredibly valuable — it included expert-led presentations, downloadable slide decks for later review, and the voucher that ultimately allowed me to sit the exam at no cost.

Live sessions can add context, structure, and motivation that you simply don’t get from books or tutorials alone. That said, **Microsoft’s official learning paths for AI-900 are excellent** — so even if you can’t attend a live event, self-study remains a perfectly viable route.

As of 2025, the situation has evolved slightly. **Full-fee waivers are less common**, but 50% discounts are often available through Virtual Training Days. **Complete discounts still appear occasionally**, especially during Microsoft Ignite or AI Skills Challenge campaigns.

If you’re planning to pursue AI-900, I highly recommend checking out [Microsoft Events](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events). Beyond potential discounts, you’ll gain valuable insights directly from Microsoft experts — an excellent complement to your own preparation.
