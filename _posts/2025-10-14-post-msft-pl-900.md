{: .notice--info}

### ℹ️ Introduction

I earned the **PL-900 certification** in October 2022, which marked my second Microsoft credential. The experience turned out to be surprisingly enriching: it introduced me to low-code development, automation - from a different perspective compared to what was seen in [🤖 From Repetition to Automation: A Practical Review](/google-automation-python/)-, and conversational bots, showing me how the Microsoft Power Platform can empower everyday professionals to create meaningful business solutions.

### 🦾 Why the PL-900 Is Worth Your Time

* **Business-focused outcomes**: You’ll see firsthand how low-code platforms enable the rapid delivery of custom applications, automated workflows, external websites, and AI-powered solutions.
* **A foundation for growth**: Beyond the fundamentals, PL-900 sets the stage for more advanced certifications and can be directly applied to real-world challenges.

### 💡 Tips to Approach the Exam

* **Focus according to weighting**: Roughly 40% of the exam revolves around business value and platform management. That said, Power Apps and Power Automate together can account for another 40–50%, so balance your study time wisely.
* **Make use of Microsoft Learn**: The [official learning paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/pl-900t00) are free, frequently updated, and map directly to the exam. Don’t skip the linked documentation — it often clarifies edge cases.
* **Take practice tests seriously**: Microsoft’s [practice assessments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/practice-assessments-for-microsoft-certifications) mirror the actual exam format and highlight areas that need reinforcement.
* **Know the exam mechanics**:  
  - Expect ~40–60 questions in multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, or true/false formats. 
  - You’ll have [~45 minutes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/exam-duration-exam-experience#exam-duration) to complete the test, need a score of [700/1000](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exam-scoring-reports#scores-needed-to-pass-exams) to pass, and can choose between online proctoring or an in-person Pearson VUE center.

### 🗂️ How I Studied

Since this was my second Microsoft exam, I reused and refined the same study approach that had worked well for the [SC-900](/msft-sc-900/):  

* **Collect and organize study materials** from the start.
* **Watch [John Savill's Study Cram video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbPHM-MiEUA)** - it distills the essentials engagingly and practically.
* **Work through Microsoft's [PL-900 course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/pl-900t00)**. It’s structured, free, and always up to date.
* **Do a second pass with [John Savill's Study Cram session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbPHM-MiEUA)** after finishing the learning paths. It reinforces key points and strengthens weaker areas. 
* **Stay confident on exam day**. Trust your preparation, manage your time, and focus on what you know rather than second-guessing.

### 🎟️ Discounts and Vouchers

When I sat for PL-900 in 2022, I managed to secure a free exam voucher through a **Microsoft Virtual Training Day** on Power Platform. These sessions offered not only the voucher but also expert-led presentations and additional resources — a valuable combination.

Fast-forward to 2025, and things have shifted slightly. Full exam waivers are less common, but Virtual Training Days usually provide a 50% discount on the exam. Occasionally, **full discounts resurface during major events** like Microsoft Ignite or themed AI Skills Challenges.

If you’re planning for PL-900, keep an eye on [Microsoft Events](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events). Beyond the potential savings, the insights from Microsoft professionals can complement your self-study nicely.

### 📦 Wrapping It Up

I took on PL-900 partly while completing my SC-900 preparation, driven by curiosity and a desire to broaden my understanding of Microsoft’s ecosystem. You don’t have to rush the way I did — the Fundamentals series is designed to be approachable, descriptive, and not as technically deep as Associate or Expert tracks.

If you’re curious about low-code/no-code and want to explore how Microsoft tools can help streamline processes and enhance collaboration, PL-900 is an excellent place to start.

**🚨 Disclaimer:** This article is solely based on my personal account. I have not received any endorsement or compensation from Microsoft or any related party. I aim to share insights that may help others assess whether the PL-900 aligns with their own goals and needs. I also encourage you to look into available discounts, vouchers, or community resources that may help cover the costs of such exams.
