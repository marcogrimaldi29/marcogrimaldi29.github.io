## üîê SC-900 Overview: Security, Compliance & Identity Fundamentals

**Just a heads-up:** This review reflects my personal experience only.
{: .notice--info}

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

The SC-900 was the very first Microsoft certification I earned, and it turned out to be much more than just an entry point into Microsoft‚Äôs ecosystem. Preparing for this exam gave me a **well-rounded understanding of security, compliance, and identity (SCI)** ‚Äî not only in relation to Microsoft Azure and cloud services, but also from a broader, vendor-neutral perspective.  

This dual focus is one of the SC-900‚Äôs strengths: while it introduces you to Microsoft tools such as Entra ID, Defender, Sentinel, and Purview, it also grounds you in the universal SCI principles that apply across platforms, providers, and environments. As a result, **you don‚Äôt just walk away with product-specific familiarity ‚Äî you also gain transferable knowledge that strengthens your overall grasp of how SCI concepts work in practice**.  

Whether you‚Äôre exploring cloud security for the first time or aiming to reinforce your knowledge of Microsoft solutions within a bigger industry picture, SC-900 provides a balanced, accessible, and meaningful starting point.

### Why SC-900 Matters

* **Accessible yet valuable**: Designed for beginners across IT, business, or academic roles, SC-900 has no prerequisites and introduces essential security and identity fundamentals.
* **Strategic springboard**: It paves the way for advanced paths like Security Operations Analyst, Identity & Access Administrator, and other specialized roles.
* **Real-world relevance**: As organizations adopt Zero Trust and cloud-native models, SC-900 builds a strong foundation in both general SCI principles and Microsoft offerings such as Entra ID, Sentinel, Defender, and Purview.

### üí° Practical Tips for Passing SC-900

* **Prioritize by weighting**: Spend extra time on security (35‚Äì40%) and identity (25‚Äì30%), as these carry the most points.
* **Leverage official Microsoft Learn paths**: Use Microsoft‚Äôs [free learning modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/sc-900t00), which directly follow the exam outline and are updated regularly.
* **Use practice exams strategically**: Microsoft‚Äôs [practice assessments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/practice-assessments-for-microsoft-certifications) are closely aligned with the test and highlight areas needing improvement.
* **Track weak areas**: Practice assessments provide a breakdown of your performance, making it easier to focus revision where it‚Äôs most needed.
* **Familiarize yourself with logistics**:  
  - ~40‚Äì60 questions (multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, true/false)  
  - [~45 minutes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/exam-duration-exam-experience#exam-duration) duration.
  - [700/1000](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exam-scoring-reports#scores-needed-to-pass-exams) required to pass.
  - Available online (proctored) or in person at Pearson VUE centers.

### üóÇÔ∏è Study Strategy

For this certification ‚Äî and later Fundamentals exams I pursued ‚Äî I generally followed this approach:  

* **Gather and organize all relevant resources** and keep them handy.  
* **Watch [John Savill's Study Cram video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FJqb60wPSY)**. Savill has a talent for simplifying complex topics and sharing them passionately with the community for free. In short, he‚Äôs the GOAT of Azure ‚Äî I strongly recommend checking him out.  
* **Complete Microsoft‚Äôs official [SC-900 course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/sc-900t00)**. It‚Äôs comprehensive, free, and updated consistently.  
* **Re-watch [John Savill's Study Cram session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FJqb60wPSY)** after completing the learning paths. A second pass helps consolidate what you‚Äôve studied and reinforces weaker spots.  
* **Trust your preparation and stay confident on exam day.** By the time you sit for the test, you‚Äôll have built a solid foundation through structured study. Focus on what you know, manage your time wisely, and approach the exam with a clear mindset.

### üéüÔ∏è Exam Vouchers and Discounts

When I first took the SC-900 back in 2022, I was fortunate enough to obtain a free exam voucher through the attendance of a **Microsoft Virtual Training Day** focused on Security, Compliance, and Identity. The experience was valuable in many ways: the event included presentations from Microsoft experts, extra slide decks to review later, and the voucher that ultimately allowed me to sit the exam free of charge.  

That experience taught me an important lesson ‚Äî preparing for a certification doesn‚Äôt just come from self-study. Sometimes, the additional context, resources, and motivation you get from live events can make a real difference.  

As of 2025, the landscape has shifted a bit. I‚Äôm not aware of any ongoing 100% discount offers tied to Virtual Training Days. However, attending one of these events usually provides a **50% discount** on the related certification exam. Full-fee waivers are still possible but tend to be tied to special occasions, such as **Microsoft Ignite** or **AI Skills Challenges**.  

If you‚Äôre considering SC-900, I strongly recommend keeping an eye on [Microsoft Events](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events). You might gain not only a voucher but also practical takeaways directly from Microsoft professionals, which can complement your independent study efforts.

### üì¶ Final Thoughts and Key Takeaways

The SC-900 is a solid first step into security, compliance, and identity. It‚Äôs approachable, logically structured, and offers transferable insights that benefit both Microsoft specialists and those working across cloud platforms.  

Since passing this exam back in 2022, I‚Äôve reflected on some key takeaways for success:  

* **Know the tools and their purpose**: Microsoft Fundamentals exams emphasize being able to *describe concepts* and *explain capabilities*. A broad grasp of the ecosystem goes a long way.  
* **Leverage Microsoft‚Äôs naming conventions**: Many solutions are aptly named (e.g., ‚ÄúAzure Firewall,‚Äù ‚ÄúAzure DDoS Protection‚Äù), making it easier to deduce functionality. Just be mindful of historically frequent rebranding.  
* **Adapt to your own style**: Everyone‚Äôs preparation looks different. Identify where you‚Äôre strong and adjust your strategy for weaker areas. For me, compliance solutions (25%) and differentiating the various Defender products (40%) were the toughest. My workaround was to aim for near-perfect accuracy in the other sections while improving my understanding on those weak spots.  
* **Manage time wisely**: If stress or uncertainty slows you down, flag difficult questions and revisit them later. Often, clarity comes after working through the rest of the exam.  

**Disclaimer:** This article is solely based on my personal account. I have not received any endorsement or compensation from Microsoft or any related party. I aim to share insights that may help others assess whether the SC-900 aligns with their own goals and needs. Whenever possible, I also encourage you to look into available discounts, vouchers or community resources that may help cover the costs of such exams.
