## 🔐 DP-900 Overview: Azure Data Fundamentals

**❗ Just a heads-up:** This review reflects my personal experience only. It is not sponsored or endorsed in any way.
{: .notice--info}

### ℹ️ Introduction

My goal with the **DP-900**: Azure Data Fundamentals certification was to deepen my overall data literacy and see how Microsoft’s approach compares with what I learned during the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/google-data-analytics/). DP-900 covers the **fundamentals of data storage, data processing, analytics, and visualization within Azure, including core data concepts, relational and non-relational services, and common data workloads**. Together, these topics offer a clear view of how Microsoft structures its data platform and how these services are applied in real-world solutions. It’s an excellent way to build a well-rounded understanding of modern data principles.

### 🛢️ Why DP-900 Matters

**Data is the backbone of modern business**, and knowing how to manage, store, and interpret it effectively is essential. The DP-900 certification offers a strong foundation in core data concepts and the Azure services that support them, making it an ideal starting point for anyone pursuing data-related roles within the Microsoft ecosystem.

Beyond Azure, **much of the knowledge covered in DP-900** — from database fundamentals to analytics workloads — **also applies across other cloud platforms and industry tools**. This makes it a versatile, vendor-agnostic certification that complements both Microsoft’s offerings and broader data career paths.

### 💡 Practical Tips for Passing SC-900

* **Leverage official Microsoft Learn paths**: Use Microsoft’s [free learning modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/dp-900t00), which directly follow the exam outline and are updated regularly.
* **Use practice exams strategically**: Microsoft’s [practice assessments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/practice-assessments-for-microsoft-certifications) are closely aligned with the test and highlight areas needing improvement.
* **Track weak areas**: Practice assessments provide a breakdown of your performance, making it easier to focus revision where it’s most needed.
* **Know the exam mechanics**:  
  - Expect ~40–60 questions in multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, or true/false formats. 
  - You’ll have [~45 minutes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/support/exam-duration-exam-experience#exam-duration) to complete the test, need a score of [700/1000](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exam-scoring-reports#scores-needed-to-pass-exams) to pass, and can choose between online proctoring or an in-person Pearson VUE center.

### 🗂️ Study Strategy

For this certification — and other Fundamentals ones I achieved — I generally sticked to this approach:  

* **Gather and organize all relevant resources** and keep them handy. Feel free to discover new content on your own, but should you feel overwhelmed, focus on what you know and trust your instincts, that gut feeling of yours is often right - and the resources below should be more than enough to ace the exam.
* **Watch [John Savill's Study Cram video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gtpasITVnk)**. Same old as with any other Azure-related exam: John Savill’s videos are a fantastic way to distill the essentials in an engaging and practical manner.
* **Complete Microsoft’s official [DP-900 course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/dp-900t00)**. It’s comprehensive, free, and updated consistently.  
* **Re-watch [John Savill's Study Cram session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gtpasITVnk)** after completing the learning paths. It may help you reinforce key points and shore up any weak areas.
* **Be confident and give your best shot on exam day**. By the time you sit for the test, you’ll have built a solid foundation by going through these materials.

### 🎟️ Exam Vouchers and Discounts

When I first took the DP-900 at the beginning of 2023, I was fortunate enough to obtain a free exam voucher through a **Microsoft Virtual Training Day** focused on Azure Data Fundametals and covering the content of this cert, similarly as done with other cert-related trainings and certificates. You can read more about my experience with the [SC-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-sc-900/), [PL-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-pl-900/), [AZ-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-az-900/) and [AI-900](https://marcogrimaldi29.com/microsoft-ai-900/) by clicking on them. 

As of 2025 and to the best of my knowledge, Microsoft still offers such opportunities periodically, although they are usually tied to specific events or promotions. So if you’re considering DP-900, I strongly recommend keeping an eye on [Microsoft Events](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events) or subscribing to newsletters that may alert you to upcoming training days or similar initiatives. These events can be a great way to deepen your understanding of Azure services while also potentially earning a free exam voucher.
