### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Intro 

In any profession, you‚Äôre expected to solve problems. But what if you could go a step further ‚Äî anticipate them, prevent them, and even discover opportunities hidden in plain sight? That‚Äôs the power of data. Whether you‚Äôre managing a classroom, running a business, supporting customers, or working in IT, the ability to understand and act on data is becoming a core skill.

For me, this wasn‚Äôt about becoming a full-time Data Analyst. It was about future-proofing my career. In an era shaped by AI, automation, and ever-expanding datasets, data literacy is no longer reserved for technical roles. Teachers, project managers, marketers, healthcare professionals, and countless others can benefit from knowing how to collect, interpret, and visualize data to make better decisions.

I‚Äôve always believed in lifelong learning and in making the most of accessible resources. Thanks to a grant from [Experiencia Fundae](https://experienciafundae.es/beca-google), I decided to take on a new challenge and enrolled in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) back in 2021. That choice opened a door to skills and perspectives that I now apply far beyond IT.
