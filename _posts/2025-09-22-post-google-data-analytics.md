**‚ùó Just a heads-up:** This review reflects my personal experience only.
{: .notice--info}

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Intro 

In any profession, learning often revolves around solving problems. But what if you could anticipate them instead? What if you could use data not only to fix what‚Äôs broken, but also to build something better or spot potential issues before they ever arise? These were the questions that drew me toward data analytics ‚Äî even while I was still working full-time as a teacher and only just starting to explore the world of IT.

I wasn‚Äôt aiming to become a Data Analyst; I was looking to future-proof my career. In an era shaped by data, AI, and emerging technologies, I quickly realized that being able to work effectively with data wasn‚Äôt just a niche skill for tech specialists ‚Äî it was becoming an essential competency for professionals across all industries.

I‚Äôve always believed in lifelong learning, and I see access to educational resources as the foundation for upskilling, provided the motivation is there. Thanks to a grant from [Experiencia Fundae](https://experienciafundae.es/beca-google), I was able to take a step forward in 2021 by enrolling in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics), a program that marked the beginning of a new chapter in my professional journey.
