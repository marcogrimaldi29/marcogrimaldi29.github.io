## üóÉÔ∏è My Journey into Data: Why Taking on a New Challenge

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Intro 

In the world of IT, you learn to solve problems. But what if you could anticipate them? What if you could use data to not only fix what's broken but to build something better or proactively spot an issue before it could cause an impact? These were the questions that sparked my interest in data analytics, even as a full-time employee.

I wasn't looking to become a Data Analyst; I was looking to future-proof my career. In an era dominated by data, AI, and emerging technologies, I expected that understanding how to efficiently work with data was no longer an option ‚Äî it was a necessity for a plethora of different jobs. 

I firmly believe in the power of lifelong learning and that having access to educational resources is key to upskilling if motivation follows. Thanks to a grant obtained via [Experiencia Fundae](https://experienciafundae.es/beca-google), I embarked on a new journey by enrolling in the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) back in 2021.
