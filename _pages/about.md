## 🚧 About this Website

This website is my effort to maintain an up-to-date digital presence for my personal brand.  
Its purpose is to connect with peers, share ideas, explore collaboration opportunities, and hopefully give something back from what I’ve learned so far in this journey.  

It’s an ongoing exercise to:
- keep writing about the things I love — technology, languages, lifelong learning, and some of my passions too  
- refresh and practice front-end, Markdown, and Git skills  
- shape a personal, platform-agnostic digital space
